# Embedded Linux Toolchain README

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of the Embedded Linux toolchain, its components, and the steps to set it up for your development environment. The toolchain is essential for compiling source code into executables that can run on embedded Linux devices. This document outlines the actions you need to take to get started with an Embedded Linux project.

## What is a Toolchain?
A toolchain is the foundation of an Embedded Linux development environment. It consists of a set of tools such as compilers, linkers, libraries, and debuggers. This toolchain is used to compile source code into executables that can run on your target device.

## Embedded Linux Elements
Embedded Linux systems are composed of four essential elements:
1. **Toolchain**: The toolchain is the first component we use to compile code for the target device.
2. **Bootloader**: A bootloader is responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the kernel.
3. **Kernel**: The kernel is the core of the operating system, managing hardware resources.
4. **Root Filesystem**: The root filesystem contains the system's directory structure and essential files.

Initially, you need a toolchain to build the other three elements of an embedded Linux system.

## GNU Toolchain Components
The GNU toolchain, widely used for Embedded Linux development, consists of:
1. **Binutils**: A set of binary utilities, including an assembler and linker.
2. **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: A collection of compilers for C and other programming languages.
3. **C Library**: This library standardizes the Application Programming Interface (API) based on POSIX specifications, serving as the main interface to the kernel.

## Why Do We Need Linux Headers?
Linux headers contain definitions and constants necessary when accessing the kernel directly and for compiling the C library. They provide essential information for proper interaction with the kernel.

## Types of Toolchains
There are two main types of toolchains:
1. **Native Toolchain**: Runs on the same architecture as the target device.
2. **Cross Toolchain**: Runs on a different architecture than the target device. This is the most common type for embedded development.

## Choosing the C Library
The C library serves as the gateway to the kernel for Linux programs and runtime libraries in other languages. The main options include:
1. **glibc**: The standard GNU C library, providing a complete implementation of the POSIX API.
2. **musl libc**: A relatively new library gaining attention for being small and POSIX-compliant.
3. **uClibc-ng**: Initially developed for uClinux, suitable for embedded usage.
4. **eglibc**: A fork of glibc with changes to make it more suitable for embedded applications.

## Building a Toolchain using Crosstool-ng
To build a toolchain using Crosstool-ng:
1. Clone the Crosstool-ng repository.
2. Navigate to the Crosstool-ng directory and run the `bootstrap` script.
3. Configure the installation prefix to avoid requiring root permissions.
4. Build the toolchain using `bin/ct-ng`.

## Building a Toolchain for RPI3
To build a toolchain for the Raspberry Pi 3 (RPI3):
1. List all samples and choose the RPI3 configuration.
2. Review and modify the configuration using the `menuconfig` command.
3. Disable rendering the toolchain read-only.
4. Build the toolchain (this may take some time).

## Linking with Static and Dynamic Libraries
Libraries come in two forms: static and dynamic.
- **Static libraries**: Include all library functions and dependencies, bound into executables. Suitable for small systems.
- **Dynamic libraries**: Referenced at runtime, allowing more efficient storage and memory usage. Object code for shared libraries must be position-independent.
